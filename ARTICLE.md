# Creating a contact list with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS

This is a simple project which is part of a series of articles I'd like to present. As it's the first one, we are starting, well, simple. Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. The plan is to create the same type of app first like it is presented here then do a second iteration with some frameworks and libraries, Node.js, React.js, Postgres and a few more doodas.
